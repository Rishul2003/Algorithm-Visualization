## Pathfinding Algorithms

### Breadth First Search (BFS)

Breadth First Search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node and explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

### Depth First Search (DFS)

Depth First Search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Best First Search

Best First Search is a search algorithm which explores a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule.

### Dijkstra Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

### A* Algorithm

A* is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its performance and accuracy. It uses heuristics to improve the efficiency of the search.

## Searching Algorithms

### Linear Search

Linear Search is a simple search algorithm that checks every element in the list until the desired element is found or the list ends.

### Jump Search

Jump Search is an algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array by jumping ahead by fixed steps and then doing a linear search within a block.

### Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### Exponential Search

Exponential Search involves two steps: finding the range where the element is present, and then performing a binary search within that range.
